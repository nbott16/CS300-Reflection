# CS300-Reflection
In this course we were dealing with binary trees, hahs tables and linked list to store an dsort data. We had to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and in turn apply them when needed for certain types of data. When encountering roadblocks I would research the data structure further or find examples to guide me in the right direction. This project expanded my approach to designing software by teaching me different ways to store and incorporaste data in said software efficiently. This project expanded how I can make my code adpatable and maintainable by usuing a common structure all the time and labeling what each line or section does to make it easy to figure out what would need changed.
